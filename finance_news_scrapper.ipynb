    "# Description of the `FinanceNewsScraper` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `FinanceNewsScraper` class is designed to scrape financial news articles from the business section of Google News based on a set of specified buzzwords and a given date range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization (`__init__`)**: \n",
    "  - The scraper accepts two sets of buzzwords:\n",
    "    - **Must-have buzzwords**: Keywords that must appear in the article title or description.\n",
    "    - **Percentage-based buzzwords**: Keywords that need to match a certain percentage within the article.\n",
    "  - It also takes a `start_date`, `end_date`, and an interval for scraping in chunks (e.g., weekly).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **URL Construction (`construct_url`)**: \n",
    "  - This function builds a Google News RSS URL specifically for the business section, incorporating the provided buzzwords and date range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fetching Data (`fetch_rss_feed`)**: \n",
    "  - This function retrieves the RSS feed using the constructed URL, retrying up to three times if errors are encountered.\n",
    "  - **Robust Retry Mechanism**:\n",
    "      - To ensure stable scraping even when there are network issues, the class includes a retry mechanism. It retries the process multiple times if it fails to retrieve the Yahoo Finance page, adding reliability to the data extraction process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keyword Matching**:\n",
    "  - **Must-have buzzwords**: Ensures that at least one must-have buzzword appears in the article's title or description.\n",
    "  - **Percentage-based buzzwords**: Verifies that a minimum percentage of the provided buzzwords are present in the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Article Parsing (`parse_articles`)**: \n",
    "  - This function parses the RSS feed and extracts relevant information such as the article title, URL, and publication date, but only for articles that match the buzzword criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scraping (`scrape`)**: \n",
    "  - This method iterates through the specified date range, fetching and parsing articles in chunks as defined by the provided interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Saving to CSV (`save_to_csv`)**: \n",
    "  - After scraping, the articles are saved to a CSV file using the `pandas` library for easy storage and further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class simplifies the process of scraping Google News for business-related articles based on keywords, while also offering functionality to save the results as a CSV file for later analysis.\n"
