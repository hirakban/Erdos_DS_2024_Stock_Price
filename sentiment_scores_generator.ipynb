    "The `SentimentScoreAnalyzer` class analyzes the sentiment of news articles for a specific stock. Given a set of keywords and a stock symbol, it identifies relevant articles, fetches article text, and calculates sentiment scores using VADER.\n",

    "#### Key Methods:\n",
    "- `map_article_to_stock(article_title, article_text)`: Checks if the article contains any keywords related to the specified stock, returning the stock symbol if it does.\n",
    "- `fetch_article_text(url)`: Retrieves and parses the full text of an article from a URL. Handles common HTTP errors and issues during retrieval.\n",
    "- `add_sentiment_scores_to_df(df, filename)`: Processes a DataFrame of article URLs and titles, calculates sentiment scores for articles that match the stock's keywords, and saves the results with sentiment scores in a CSV file.\n",

    "This class is useful for quantifying sentiment in financial news articles to gauge market sentiment on a specific stock.\n"
